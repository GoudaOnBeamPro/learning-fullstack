      The action attr. tells our web app where to send data
      The method attr. tells our web app what HTTP method to use. It's either
      GET or POST.
      The name attr. gives a name to the data that then shows up in the query
      string in the URL.
      Labels make the inputs in our forms accessible to screen-readers. The
      for attr. must match the id attr. for the corresponding input.
      The required attr. makes sure that there is something in the input when
      the form is submitted. This is called the presence validation. This is
      not implemented in all browsers.
      Type validations make sure the input is of the specified type. It's as
      simple as changing the type of the input attr.
